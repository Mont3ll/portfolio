This project is the official corporate website for Elitemetrix Solutions, "Your Gateway to East African Opportunities." It's built using Next.js (App Router) and features a dynamic, multilingual frontend designed to effectively communicate the company's services, values, and achievements while providing a platform for global client engagement.

    - Integrated contact and quote request forms with email notifications (Nodemailer backend).
    - Embedded Calendly widget for direct consultation booking.
- **SEO Optimized**: Implemented on-page and technical SEO best practices for enhanced visibility.
