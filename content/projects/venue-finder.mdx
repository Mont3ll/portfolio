This is a full-stack venue finder platform built with Next.js and Python. It's similar to Airbnb but specifically designed for finding and booking venues for events. The platform uses a Python backend API with FastAPI and a Next.js frontend for a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Venue Search & Filtering**: Search venues by location, capacity, amenities, and event type.
- **Interactive Map**: View venues on an interactive map with detailed location information.
- **Booking System**: Complete booking flow with availability checking and reservation management.
- **User Profiles**: Separate profiles for venue owners and event organizers.
- **Review System**: Rate and review venues after events.
- **Photo Galleries**: Upload and browse high-quality venue photos.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling for venue bookings.
- **Calendar Integration**: Real-time availability calendar for venues.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: React framework for the frontend with server-side rendering.
- **Python**: Backend API built with FastAPI for high performance.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing venue, user, and booking data.
- **Redis**: Caching layer for improved performance.
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for secure transactions.
- **Cloudinary**: Image storage and optimization for venue photos.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for the Next.js frontend.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and set up both the backend and frontend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mont3ll/venuefinder_backend.git
cd venuefinder_backend

# Setup Python backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup Next.js frontend
git clone https://github.com/Mont3ll/venuefinder.git
cd venuefinder
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in both backend and frontend directories with the required environment variables.

Start the development servers:

```bash
# Backend (Python/FastAPI)
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend (Next.js)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The application is deployed with:
- **Backend**: Python API deployed on Railway or Heroku
- **Frontend**: Next.js app deployed on Vercel
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase or Railway
